Attrition bias occurs when randomized patients are not taken into account in the main analysis. All randomized patients must be included in the ITT analysis. Patients who are included but not analyzed correspond either to those lost to follow-up or to missing data, which in both cases makes the primary outcome missing. The definition of selection bias varies according to authors. The CNCI proposed the following definition: Bias in the constitution of the sample, which will be unrepresentative of the general population for factors related to the studied problem (hence the bias). Publication bias is mentioned, for example, when a negative study is not published. Consequently, a literature review based solely on published studies can be biased.",

Thus, treatment allocation should not depend on the severity of the disease, the patient's characteristics, or the context of the care given to the patient. Only a random assignment can guarantee the complete independence of the nature of the treatment given with respect to these factors. Otherwise, if a treatment is given more specifically to patients of a certain type, the groups will no longer be comparable and there will be bias. To achieve this independence, treatments are randomly assigned to patients. Thus, each patient, regardless of their characteristics, has the same probability of receiving one treatment or the other. Randomization creates two groups of patients that are comparable on average. Random sampling fluctuations may cause a difference between the groups that does not actually exist. In a situation where the risk is identical in the 2 groups, by chance, the percentage observed in one group may be lower than it should have been while in the other group, chance leads to an observed value overestimating the true value. Conversely, random fluctuations can also make a difference that does exist disappear. It is the performance of a statistical test that allows us to conclude, from the observation, on the existence (or not) of a true difference between the two groups. Faced with an observed difference, the statistical test allows us to calculate the probability that we would have of observing this result if in reality there was no difference between the two groups. This probability is called p. Classically, it has been agreed that the acceptable alpha error risk is 5%. Thus, in the face of an observed difference, we will conclude that there is a real difference only if the risk of being wrong in making this conclusion is less than 5%, that is, if the p-value given by the test is less than the 5% threshold.",

It then becomes possible to arrange the moment a patient will be included so that they receive the desired treatment. Only a computerized randomization procedure sufficiently guarantees its unpredictability. The number or nature of the treatment is obtained by calling a randomization center and after registering the patient being included in the trial. Randomization must take place after verifying the patient's eligibility and just before the start of care to avoid as much as possible that randomized subjects ultimately do not participate in the study due to consent withdrawal or the occurrence of an event preventing them from continuing the study, for example... Double-blinding avoids all differences in the follow-up and evaluation of the two groups. The principle of double-blinding is to make all patients, regardless of their group in the trial, appear identical. This is achieved by not revealing the exact nature of the treatment received by the patients. Randomization does not guarantee double-blinding or identical follow-up of the 2 groups, the proof is that this is an open-label study despite a randomization of the transfusion strategy.",

This is a monocentric trial without stratification on the center but a stratification on the center frequently performed in multicenter trials consists of balancing the number of patients receiving strategy or treatment A and receiving B within each center. It minimizes the center effect which arises from the fact that recruitment and care vary according to the center. The advantage of block randomization is to limit imbalances between the groups as much as possible, since approximately as many patients will receive each treatment. However, to guarantee total unpredictability, the use of blocks of different sizes is recommended.",

A multiple criterion requires the performance of several statistical tests. It can be considered that the reduction of death and/or cardiovascular events is meaningful for patients. This would be more debatable for criteria such as the reduction of LDL-cholesterol or blood pressure. An objective criterion is measured in the most consensual way possible, and its measurement has the same meaning for the different observers (for example, cardiovascular event, death...). A subjective measurement is influenced by the psychological state of the person (for example, pain VAS, quality of life questionnaire). A quantitative variable is a measurement that can have a mean and a standard deviation (an age, the value of a VAS, a quality of life score, a systolic blood pressure, BMI). A qualitative variable is a percentage (patients who died or with a cardiovascular event, patient with a BMI > 30 ...).",

E: TRUE: the stability of the results after exclusion of deaths that occurred during the first 8 years is an argument in favor of the temporal sequence. Indeed, this exclusion makes it possible to remove from the analysis a part of the patients who would have started their consumption of artificially sweetened beverages because of symptoms of cardiovascular disease. This therefore strengthens the conviction that the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages precedes the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, and thus the cause-effect temporality.",

Attrition bias occurs when randomized patients are excluded from the analysis. Here all randomized patients were analyzed (ITT). The lost-to-follow-up patients were considered to have had no event, which is an assertion that is not verified since the patient is lost to follow-up. Other choices would have been possible, the worst-case scenario or maximum bias: all patients who received the treatment had the event and the placebo patients did not; or the reverse (best-case). Or again, all of them had it, treatment or placebo. One can also perform multiple imputation by extrapolating the possible results according to the characteristics of the patients for each of the groups. The maximum bias hypothesis consists of considering the lost-to-follow-up patients in the beta-blocker group as having had the event and no event in the placebo group; this would lead to a slightly higher rate of events in the beta-blocker group: 27-5=22 events in the placebo group vs 16+9=25 events in the beta-blocker group",

Even the authors recognize it. « The difference was largely due to a significantly reduced incidence of ascites... » Extrapolation is only possible by taking into account the target population. Investigators and patients saw during titration that such a dose led to a reduction in heart rate, so they can realize that the dose administered after randomization has less impact (if it is a placebo and not a beta-blocker), which poses a problem for perfect blinding, as there is a possibility of guessing the nature of the treatment by monitoring heart rate and interpreting whether or not there is a decrease.",

If information is missing that may be related to the choice of treatment, then the propensity score may be incorrectly estimated without knowing the direction of the residual bias. Prescribing a drug does not guarantee that it will be taken, which tends to “dilute” the potential effect and therefore bring the HR towards 1. A result significantly different from 1 is therefore all the more credible. The hypothesis formulated in response E is discussed by the authors in the study limitations. In this case, the association between fluoroquinolones and the risk of dissection/aneurysm would be increased, leading to an overestimation of the HR",

It is therefore necessary to take a Type I error risk of less than 5% for the interim analysis. Different methods exist, including Pocock's method used here, which requires taking a Type I error risk of 3.34% for the interim analysis, therefore a confidence interval of 96.66%. The existence of 2 primary endpoints (another problem of multiplicity of tests) is not mentioned in the article and is not subject to a correction for multiplicity of tests. This may seem suspicious but the protocol provided for a hierarchical analysis for the 2 primary endpoints, which allows to dispense with an adjustment on the Type I error risk. The analyses related to the secondary endpoints, which do not involve an adjustment for multiplicity of tests, must be considered exploratory and not confirmatory. Using 95% confidence intervals for the purpose of testing a hypothesis would not guarantee an overall Type I error risk of less than 5%.",

The draw, without a block, could lead to a very large number of patients being included first in one arm. So at a given time in the study, there would be an imbalance. stratification by center allows recruiting the same number of patients in each arm within the same center. in case of blocks of always identical and small size, it is indeed possible for the investigator to guess the arm in which the patient will be randomized. blinding and the random size of the blocks help to limit this risk.",
