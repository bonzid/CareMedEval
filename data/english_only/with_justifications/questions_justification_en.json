Research must not involve disproportionate risks compared to potential benefits, a principle of beneficence. The equivalent in France of the dedicated trial committee is the CPP. Consent must be prior to any involvement in a research activity, free, informed, and express.

In our case, an add-on trial, all patients received the current treatment, the placebo was chosen to maintain the blind. The principle of double-blindness is to make all patients, regardless of their belonging to one of the trial groups, appear identical. To achieve a double-blind, it is necessary that all patients apparently receive the same treatment. The placebo in a trial has two roles: to ensure the indistinguishability of the two groups to carry out the double-blind, and to create the necessary conditions for the appearance of the placebo effect in the patients of the control group in order to take this confounding factor into account. Ambivalence clause: Any patient included in a therapeutic trial must be able to receive any of the treatments studied, and therefore have no contraindications to any of the treatments.",

Evaluation bias occurs when the measurement of the outcome is not performed in the same way in the two groups. Double-blindness limits the risk of evaluation bias. Attrition bias occurs when randomized patients are not taken into account in the main analysis. All randomized patients must be included in the ITT analysis. Patients who are included but not analyzed correspond either to those lost to follow-up or to missing data, which in both cases makes the primary outcome missing. The definition of selection bias varies according to authors. The CNCI proposed the following definition: Bias in the constitution of the sample, which will be unrepresentative of the general population for factors related to the studied problem (hence the bias). Publication bias is mentioned, for example, when a negative study is not published. Consequently, a literature review based solely on published studies can be biased.",

    "justification": "To avoid selection bias, the nature of the treatment a patient receives should not depend on any factor likely to influence the outcome. Thus, treatment allocation should not depend on the severity of the disease, the patient's characteristics, or the context of the care given to the patient. Only a random assignment can guarantee the complete independence of the nature of the treatment given with respect to these factors. Otherwise, if a treatment is given more specifically to patients of a certain type, the groups will no longer be comparable and there will be bias. To achieve this independence, treatments are randomly assigned to patients. Thus, each patient, regardless of their characteristics, has the same probability of receiving one treatment or the other. Randomization creates two groups of patients that are comparable on average. Random sampling fluctuations may cause a difference between the groups that does not actually exist. In a situation where the risk is identical in the 2 groups, by chance, the percentage observed in one group may be lower than it should have been while in the other group, chance leads to an observed value overestimating the true value. Conversely, random fluctuations can also make a difference that does exist disappear. It is the performance of a statistical test that allows us to conclude, from the observation, on the existence (or not) of a true difference between the two groups. Faced with an observed difference, the statistical test allows us to calculate the probability that we would have of observing this result if in reality there was no difference between the two groups. This probability is called p. Classically, it has been agreed that the acceptable alpha error risk is 5%. Thus, in the face of an observed difference, we will conclude that there is a real difference only if the risk of being wrong in making this conclusion is less than 5%, that is, if the p-value given by the test is less than the 5% threshold.",

    "justification": "Randomization was stratified on the presence or absence of cirrhosis, which improves the initial comparability of the groups on this variable and removes the effect of the confounding factor that is the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Randomization was based on the use of sealed envelopes, which has the disadvantage of allowing (by fraud) an early awareness of the nature of the treatment that future patients will receive. It then becomes possible to arrange the moment a patient will be included so that they receive the desired treatment. Only a computerized randomization procedure sufficiently guarantees its unpredictability. The number or nature of the treatment is obtained by calling a randomization center and after registering the patient being included in the trial. Randomization must take place after verifying the patient's eligibility and just before the start of care to avoid as much as possible that randomized subjects ultimately do not participate in the study due to consent withdrawal or the occurrence of an event preventing them from continuing the study, for example... Double-blinding avoids all differences in the follow-up and evaluation of the two groups. The principle of double-blinding is to make all patients, regardless of their group in the trial, appear identical. This is achieved by not revealing the exact nature of the treatment received by the patients. Randomization does not guarantee double-blinding or identical follow-up of the 2 groups, the proof is that this is an open-label study despite a randomization of the transfusion strategy.",

This is a monocentric trial without stratification on the center but a stratification on the center frequently performed in multicenter trials consists of balancing the number of patients receiving strategy or treatment A and receiving B within each center. It minimizes the center effect which arises from the fact that recruitment and care vary according to the center. The advantage of block randomization is to limit imbalances between the groups as much as possible, since approximately as many patients will receive each treatment.

This would be more debatable for criteria such as the reduction of LDL-cholesterol or blood pressure. An objective criterion is measured in the most consensual way possible, and its measurement has the same meaning for the different observers (for example, cardiovascular event, death...). A subjective measurement is influenced by the psychological state of the person (for example, pain VAS, quality of life questionnaire). A quantitative variable is a measurement that can have a mean and a standard deviation (an age, the value of a VAS, a quality of life score, a systolic blood pressure, BMI).

It is therefore necessary to take a Type I error risk of less than 5% for the interim analysis. Different methods exist, including Pocock's method used here, which requires taking a Type I error risk of 3.34% for the interim analysis, therefore a confidence interval of 96.66%. The existence of 2 primary endpoints (another problem of multiplicity of tests) is not mentioned in the article and is not subject to a correction for multiplicity of tests. This may seem suspicious but the protocol provided for a hierarchical analysis for the 2 primary endpoints, which allows to dispense with an adjustment on the Type I error risk. The analyses related to the secondary endpoints, which do not involve an adjustment for multiplicity of tests, must be considered exploratory and not confirmatory. Using 95% confidence intervals for the purpose of testing a hypothesis would not guarantee an overall Type I error risk of less than 5%.",
